## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Upload Fails**:
1. **File too large error**: 
   - We already cleaned up large files, this shouldn't happen
   - If it does, check for any remaining large files

2. **Network timeout**:
   - Try uploading in smaller batches
   - Upload folders one by one

3. **Permission error**:
   - Make sure you're signed in to GitHub
   - Check repository settings

### **Alternative Upload Methods**:

#### **Method A: Upload by Folders**
1. Upload `src/` folder first
2. Then upload `test/` folder
3. Then upload `docs/` folder
4. Finally upload remaining files

#### **Method B: Use GitHub Desktop**
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Clone your empty repository
3. Copy all files to the cloned folder
4. Commit and push
